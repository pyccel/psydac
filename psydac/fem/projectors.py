def knot_insertion_projection_operator(domain, codomain):
    """
    Compute the projection operator based on the knot insertion technique.

    Return a linear operator which projects an element of the domain to an
    element of the codomain. Domain and codomain are scalar spline spaces over
    a cuboid, built as the tensor product of 1D spline spaces. In particular,
    domain and codomain have the same multi-degree (p1, p2, ...).

    This function returns a LinearOperator K working at the level of the
    spline coefficients, which are represented by StencilVector objects.

    Thanks to the tensor-product structure of the spline spaces, the projection
    operator is the Kronecker product of 1D projection operators K[i] operating
    between 1D spaces. Each 1D operators is represented by a dense matrix:

        K = K[0] x K[1] x ...

    For each dimension i the 1D grids defined by the breakpoints of the two
    spaces are assumed to be identical, or one nested into the other. Let nd[i]
    and nc[i] be the number of cells along dimension i for domain and codomain,
    respectively. We then have three different cases:

    1. nd[i] == nc[i]:
       The two 1D grids are assumed identical, and K[i] is the identity matrix.

    2. nd[i] < nc[i]:
       The 1D grid of the domain is assumed nested into the 1D grid of the
       codomain, hence the 1D spline space of the domain is a subspace of the
       1D spline space of the codomain. In this case we build K[i] using the
       knot insertion algorithm.

    3. nd[i] > nc[i]:
       The 1D grid of the codomain is assumed nested into the 1D grid of the
       domain, hence the 1D spline space of the codomain is a subspace of the
       1D spline space of the domain. In this case we build K[i] as the
       transpose of the matrix obtained using the knot insertion algorithm from
       the codomain to the domain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    domain : TensorFemSpace
        Domain of the projection operator.

    codomain : TensorFemSpace
        Codomain of the projection operator.

    Returns
    -------
    KroneckerDenseMatrix
        Matrix representation of the projection operator. This is a
        LinearOperator acting on the spline coefficients.
