|Psydac is a high-level finite-element library in Python 3, that uses high-order splines, mapped domains and MPI parallelization.|
|                                                                                                                                |
|In order to use Psydac, the user provides a geometry analytically or through an input file, and then defines the model equations|
|in symbolic form (weak formulation) using Sympde, which provides the mathematical expressions and checks the semantic validity  |
|of the model.                                                                                                                   |   
|                                                                                                                                |                              
|Once a finite element discretization has been chosen, Psydac maps the abstract concepts to concrete objects, the basic building |
|blocks being MPI-distributed vectors and matrices.                                                                              |
|For all the computationally intensive operations (matrix and vector assembly, matrix-vector products, etc.), Psydac generates   |
|ad-hoc Python code which is accelerated using either Numba or Pyccel.                                                           |
