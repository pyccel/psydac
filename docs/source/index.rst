|Psydac is a Python 3 library for isogeometric analysis (IGA). It uses high-order tensor-product splines, multi-patch mapped     |
|domains, and hybrid MPI-OpenMP parallelization.                                                                                 |
|                                                                                                                                |
|In order to use Psydac, the user provides a geometry analytically or through an input file, and then defines the model equations|
|in symbolic form (weak formulation) using `SymPDE <https://github.com/pyccel/sympde>`_, which provides the mathematical         |
|expressions and checks the semantic validity of the model.                                                                     |
|                                                                                                                                |    
|Once a finite element discretization has been chosen, Psydac maps the abstract concepts to concrete objects, the basic building |
|blocks being MPI-distributed vectors and matrices.                                                                              |
|For all the computationally intensive operations (assembly of matrices, vectors, and norms, etc.), Psydac generates ad-hoc      |
|Python code which is then accelerated to Fortran speed using `Pyccel <https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel>`_.                      |
